This is the source for app-text/build-docbook-catalog, which is a
script to regenerate the xml docbook catalog.

To make a release of this script, do the following:

1. Commit your changes and copy the versioned, bzipped script to
   gentoo's distfiles:

    cvs commit build-docbook-catalog
    rev=$(awk '/^# .Header:/{print $4;exit}' build-docbook-catalog)
    echo $rev
    bzip2 -c build-docbook-catalog \
        >/usr/portage/distfiles/build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.bz2
    scp /usr/portage/distfiles/build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.bz2 \
        gentoo:/space/distfiles-local/

2. Make a new version of the build-docbook-catalog ebuild:

    ego build-docbook-catalog
    cp $(/bin/ls -t1 *.ebuild | head -n 1) build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.ebuild
    ekeyword ~all build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.ebuild

3. Do the normal steps to generate a digest, mark the previous version
   stable, use echangelog to add a ChangeLog entry, etc.

    cvs add build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.ebuild
    ebuild build-docbook-catalog-${rev}.ebuild digest
    echangelog
    repoman commit -m "version bump to ${rev}"
